# The original MAZE OF NEON
This is the original version of the game which i stopped working on in **2014**.
<br />
The game itself is pretty boring, and also ugly to look at, as I stopped working on it in an early state of development.
<br />
(After all, the game was called version ***BETA 0.0.4*** for a reason.)
<br />
<br />
The level you play through in this game is generated from a **PNG**-file, which can be changed as you like!
<br />
The PNG is located inside the **JAR**. Go to ***levels/level0.png***
