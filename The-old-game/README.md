# The original MAZE OF NEON
This is the original version of the game which i stopped working on in **2014**.
<br />
The game itself is pretty boring, and also ugly to look at, as I stopped working on it in an early state of development.
<br />
(After all, the game was called version ***BETA 0.0.4*** for a reason.)
<br />

<br />
<br />
The original game had only two textures. One for the walls, and one for the floor and ceiling.
<br />
The game also had a *minimap* (displayed at the **bottom-right corner**) which reveals all paths you have already taken.
<br />
<br />
## "Editor"!
The level you play through in this game is generated from a **PNG**-file, which can be changed however you like!
<br />
The PNG is located inside the **JAR**. Go to ***levels/level0.png***
<br />
### More info on level-editing:
**Black pixels (#000000)** creates blocks/walls.
<br />
**The red pixel (#FF0000)** sets the goalposition.
<br />
**The green pixel (#00FF00)** sets the startposition.
<br />
**The yellow pixel (#FFFF00)** determines which direction the player will be facing, and will only be read if it is adjacent to the green pixel.
<br />
**All other colors** will be read as white, which doesn't do anything.
