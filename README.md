# New MAZE OF NEON
New MAZE OF NEON (or NewMON for short) is a maze-game based on my previous game called MAZE OF NEON, which I made in pure Java a couple of years ago! This new game will also be programmed in Java, but it will also be using LWJGL 3.
<br />
## What is this project?
NewMON is a game where you have to fnd your way through a series of mazes. There is very little to be said about it for now as I'm just coming up with the gameplay-concepts while I'm programming it.
<br />
I know its bad to start coding the game before the gameplay has been properly planed, but this project is nothing serious for me. Its more like programming-practice for me...
<br />
## Where can I get the game?
All different versions of this game can be found here: https://github.com/McFlyboy/New-MAZE-OF-NEON/releases
<br />
<br />
The earliest versions are ridiculously lacking of pretty much everything, but I find it amusing looking back on early versions of games that are pretty much completed.
